 Getting Started
=================

.. note:: The code is built various usages in mind. Since there was no client, specifications or other kind of limitations we adopt a evolutive strategy when implementing solutions. Inspired in the way that opensource/free software evolve, the project also tries to be a comprehensive use technologies as in `The Arch Way <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way>`_.

    * ... are just curious about the MIBEL daily Market you can find useful information in ours project wiki;
    * ... are just curious about the data manage and its source pages you can find each component data description on ours project wiki page;
    * ... want to get the available data you can generate and download the data files from your application page;
    * ... want to explore data from each components you can take a look at your visualization gallery and download the plot and graphics;
    * ... want to explore data from each components you can take a look at your visualization gallery and download the plot and graphics;
    * ... want to contribute to the project you can check out your "How to contribute" page;
    * ... want to contribute and start developing your and fixing bugs go to the "Development strategy" page;
    * ... want incorporate some of the project modules into your work and software or infrastructure consider contact directly with the project developers;
    * ... want this software as a service you must contact project developers since this code uses libraries with non-commercial License;



The Project Free Server
=======================

The main server is hosted in openshift online.
You can:
    * ... download data from each component;

    * ... Check components data visualization and aggregations;
    
    * ... Check out our predictive methods and its back testing and validations;


rest API usage:
---------------

You can find the full API documentation here. Also if you just can You can access it directly the rest API using a rest client like https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/ or a cli inteface like curl, httpie.org similar software.


OLAP viewing:
-------------

there ins't a full OLAP visualization for the data yet but we are waiting for some contributions in order to start developing it.


Get and setup your own server 
=============================

The project is opensource but for the visualization components have a commercial license.
You can download the code from github repository. Also we have developed two docker images:



Server Docker image
-------------------




Developer Server Docker image
-----------------------------



Cloning repositoy
-----------------

1. Install a mongodb instance or just use a mongolab one;
2. Clone the repository;
3. Use the projects components to prepare data.
4. Run the Developing server.

5. Use for favorite developing tool and start contributing to the project
